Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. Facade Pattern defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.

Suppose we have an application with set of interfaces to use MySql/Oracle database and to generate different types of reports, such as HTML report, PDF report etc.

So we will have different set of interfaces to work with different types of database. Now a client application can use these interfaces to get the required database connection and generate reports.


JDBC Driver Manager class to get the database connection is a wonderful example of facade design pattern.
