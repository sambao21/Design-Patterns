Factory Pattern is one of the Creational Design pattern and itâ€™s widely used in JDK as well as frameworks like Spring and Struts.


Factory design pattern is used when we have a super class with multiple sub-classes and based on input, we need to return one of the sub-class. This pattern take out the responsibility of instantiation of a class from client program to the factory class.



Super class in factory design pattern can be an interface, abstract class or a normal java class.

Factory pattern removes the instantiation of actual implementation classes from client code. Factory pattern makes our code more robust, less coupled and easy to extend. For example, we can easily change PC class implementation because client program is unaware of this
